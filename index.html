                    About Me.
                </blockquote>
                <p>  Born in Montreal and raised in sunny Southern California, Elizabeth came to Spelman College during the summer of 2013.
                    Through the past three years, Elizabeth has developed her interests in holistic wellness and computing.
                    As an avid yogi and developer, Elizabeth strives to see how her technical skills and love of people can
                    help address some of the most prominent health issues in the Black community. After Spelman, Elizabeth
                    will join Deloitte Consulting LLP as a technology analyst to further develop her business acumen and project
                    management experience. When not studying, working or doing research, Elizabeth enjoys watching Grey's Anatomy and
                    YouTube tutorials, reading books, crafts and spending time with friends and family.</p>

                Why Computing?
            </blockquote>
            <p> The choice to study Computer Science was several years in the making. I had always grown up enjoying both
                computers and video games. My dad urged me to spend my time learning websites instead. As a kid, my dad's thoughts
                were not sufficient to convince me that web development would be worth my time. Fast forward to my first
                semester in college where a close friend encouraged me to take an introductory class. I immediately enjoyed the
                challenge and the ability to create tangible products. And the rest is history.</p>
